As a result of this built-in liquidity component, Populous at this point requires no transaction fees. In fact, the only fees levied are those associated with late payments. Populous invoice transactions can cover a huge array of industries, including many which are not typically available to traditional financing companies.\r\n\r\nThe PPT tokens not released during the ICO were retained by the founding and development team. PPT can either be held or used as collateral to invest in Populous invoices. In exchange for collateralizing, you\u2019re given an amount of Pokens based on a percentage of market value. Currently it\u2019s the lesser of 50%, or a 30 day market average. These are automatically used to purchase an invoice. If the invoice is repaid, you receive both your PPT investment and Pokens profit."}, "links": {"homepage": ["https://populous.world", "", ""], "blockchain_site": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd4fa1460f537bb9085d22c7bccb5dd450ef28e3a", "https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd4fa1460f537bb9085d22c7bccb5dd450ef28e3a", null, "", ""], "official_forum_url": ["", "", ""], "chat_url": ["", "", ""], "announcement_url": ["", ""], "twitter_screen_name": "bitpopulous", "facebook_username": "", "bitcointalk_thread_identifier": 1866936, "telegram_channel_identifier": "", "subreddit_url": null, "repos_url": {"github": ["https://github.com/bitpopulous/populous-smartcontracts"], "bitbucket": []}}, "image": {"thumb": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/753/thumb/populous.png?1548331905", "small": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/753/small/populous.png?1548331905", "large": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/753/large/populous.png?1548331905"}, "country_origin": "GB", "genesis_date": "2017-07-09", "contract_address": "0xd4fa1460f537bb9085d22c7bccb5dd450ef28e3a", "sentiment_votes_up_percentage": 66.67, "sentiment_votes_down_percentage": 33.33, "ico_data": {"ico_start_date": "2017-07-24T00:00:00.000Z", "ico_end_date": "2017-07-24T00:00:00.000Z", "short_desc": "Smart contract invoice financing platform", "description": "Populous is a smart contract invoice finance platform on the Ethereum & RSK blockchains.
