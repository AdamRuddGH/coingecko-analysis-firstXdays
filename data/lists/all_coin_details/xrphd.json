It uses the hard disk as the device for mining and obtains network block rewards according to the capacity of the hard disk.\r\n\r\nXHD mainly uses distributed book-keeping technology to solve problems in real-time cross-border payment. Compared to XRP, XHD has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n-The consensus algorithm is more decentralized. In the XHD network trusts, every miner has the right to participate and they can make their own decision. XHD trusts trillions of XHD nodes.
