 Analysis of cryptocurrency performance within launch window

 This is a work in progress. Last data extraction from CoinGecko on 2021-05-20

## The Dataset

Dataset in the `/data/processed_tables/` revolve around the first X days of a coin's release (Approx 7200 atm)

With this dataset I'd like to explore questions like:
- If I put in $10 on every coin which is released, will I profit within the first X days? (Answer is yes by like 8x based on initial analysis)
- What common traits are associated with high performers / low performers? eg:
	- community
	- ICO/IDO history
	- launch date/window
	- name
