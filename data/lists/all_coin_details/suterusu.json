Suterusu protocol can provide privacy protection for the users\u2019 transaction data without comprising efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo date, Suterusu network has 47 node operators and over 158k mining participates, collectively over 80% staking rate. With 3,000 Suter token reward per 60s, the network generated over 2bn suter token rewards since launch which bring the total circulating supply to 3.7bn suter token. Private round investor\u2019s token have been fully unlocked since Jan 2021, and the foundation\u2019s token will be unlocked by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nWhat is Suter Shield?\r\nSuter Shield is a decentralized, layer-2 solution for transaction and data-protection built on Ethereum, while also can be integrated with other layer-1 projects supporting smart contracts such as Binance Smart Chain, Heco etc.\r\n\r\nIt applies public key homomorphic encryption to protect the transactional amount and conceals the identities of the sender and receiver of a transaction among other system users through invoking zero-knowledge proof. In other words, Suterusu protocol not only provides anonymity for the involved parties and but also transactional confidentiality.\r\n\r\nSuter Shield allows the sender of a transaction to arbitrarily select the target receiver of a confidential transaction without the need of sharing any secret with the receiver beforehand. Therefore, it is not only much more user-friendly, but it also provides a foundation to adapt to more sophisticated privacy-preserving DeFi functionalities such as DEX, insurance, loan, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, compared with other similar solution, Suter Shield not only facilitates the anonymous and confidential transactions of ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but it is also a much more modularized and universal privacy-protection solution for any smart-contract platforms, which is why we can easily transform our solutions to other platforms such as BSC or HECO. Furthermore, the Suter VM not only provides anonymous payment functionality for smart contract platforms but also anonymous BTC cross-chain functionality that will bring more liquidity to the Suter ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSuterusu\u2019s vision to provide privacy-protection for the users of all digital assets, therefore, Suterusu takes regulation compliance to its heart at the beginning of the system design. We apply blacklist and recursive blacklisting to ensure our system is regulation compliant. Any Suter transfer operation is required to compare the sender accounts of a transaction to the blacklist accounts. A transaction that involves any blacklist account will be rejected. This will guarantee the Suterusu ecosystem will effectively eradicate any misbehavior that is against the financial regulation, such as money launder.\r\n\r\nSuter token is native governance and utility token. It\u2019s a fixed-supply ERC-20 token that is used for the purpose of community growth and rewards for the users participating in the Suter DAO voting.\r\n"}, "links": {"homepage":
