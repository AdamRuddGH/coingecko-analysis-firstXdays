Syscoin Bridge enables owners of ERC-20 tokens to interoperate with Syscoin without requiring second or third-party liquidity providers. By using the Syscoin bridge, ERC-20 token owners effectively gain the security, speed and low fees needed for Point-of-Sale on a decentralized network.

This can be used to ensure that all transactions of their asset are compliant before the network allows them to settle on-chain. The rules are hosted off-chain, with an on-chain signing process, making this feature scalable and flexible in the event rules must be updated.

By enforcing compliance on the blockchain, owners can no longer evade the rules that asset issuers must abide by.

All full nodes in Syscoin's network validate all transactions and serve as high-throughput relays for assets using Z-DAG Protocol. Importantly, unlike the majority of projects using masternodes, Syscoin purposely does not provide anonymity features in order to avoid potential regulatory issues. Syscoin's masternodes also provide the network a layer for future services. Learn more about Syscoin's Masternodes and the rewards they offer: https://sysnode.info\r\n\r\nRoadmap: Syscoin is researching a number of technologies including scalable smart contracts, multi-asset payment channels, and Digital Identities. Multi-asset payment channels are a new kind of off-chain solution that will be used in combination with Z-DAG to scale decentralized payment services to the demands of the global population. This would also enable users with near-instant swaps at very low fees, particularly useful for DeFi. Syscoin is also researching scalable smart-contracts using zkRollups. Syscoin also plans to universalize its interoperability tech with Zero-Knowledge Proofs in order to work with almost all blockchains. The Syscoin Roadmap is available here: https://syscoin.org/roadmap", "sv": "Known as \"\"The blockchain platform for real money, assets, and blazing-fast token payments that scale\"\", Syscoin is a public open-source blockchain that provides trustless interoperability, token microtransactions that are scalable via Syscoin's Z-DAG Protocol, and is secured by a base layer that is Bitcoin-Core-compliant and merge-mined with Bitcoin. Syscoin also provides asset issuers the option of non-custodial regulatory compliance rulesets, a feature becoming increasingly relevant in today's ledger tech industry. \r\n\r\nZ-DAG: Syscoin's Z-DAG is a proprietary blockchain throughput scalability solution that adds very little complexity. It solves the blockchain scalability challenge through proper tooling and facilitation across Syscoin's network, maximizing the utility of battle-tested Bitcoin code. This technology is based upon Satoshi's \"\"snack machine\"\" concept and provides Peer-to-Peer electronic cash functionality for assets and tokens using Syscoin Platform. Learn more about Z-DAG: https://syscoin.org/news/what-is-z-dag\r\n\r\nTrustless Interoperability: In January 2020, the project introduced a trustless and permissionless bridge technology to mainnet. Syscoin Bridge enables owners of ERC-20 tokens to interoperate with Syscoin without requiring second or third-party liquidity providers. By using the Syscoin bridge, ERC-20 token owners effectively gain the security, speed and low fees needed for Point-of-Sale on a decentralized network.
