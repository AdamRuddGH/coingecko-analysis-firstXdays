The company devises the Internet of Assets (IoA) \u2014 the online platform based on blockchain technology that allows to tokenize real assets. It works on the principles of Bank-as-a-Service (BaaS) by implementing Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to track assets valuation and condition. These technologies allows to create various instances of Smart Assets and sell them worldwide.  The company is developing a new tokenization technology that uses the blockchain technology to offer advanced Proof-of-Asset protocol for the financial markets. By using Smart Contracts, BANKEX may digitize various types of assets like portfolios including real estate, ensures that the asset is validated, turns it into a token, and places it on the market for trading. Liquidity in form of cryptocurrencies or even fiat money is just a click away for such assets owners. It gives access to capital and guarantee clear cashflow for investors. BANKEX is supported by 10 banks and have it own laboratory to develop new blockchain applications.", "links": {"web":
