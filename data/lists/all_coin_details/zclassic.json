Because the Zcash source code is open source, Zclassic simply removes the 20% Founder\u2019s Reward. This gives people the option to mine a blockchain using the same technology of Zcash, but without paying the 20% Founder\u2019s Reward.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Zclassic is to stay as similar to Zcash from a technology perspective, but to never take any pre-mine, founder\u2019s-reward or any other kind of fee that goes to a small group of individuals with special permissions whether elected, appointed, or otherwise."}, "links": {"homepage": ["http://zclassic-ce.com/", "", ""], "blockchain_site": ["https://explorer.zcl.zeltrez.io/", "", "", "", ""], "official_forum_url": ["", "", ""],
