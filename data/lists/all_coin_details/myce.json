The real value of a discount token is when it\u2019s used, it makes investors either stake their rewards until reaching another masternode, or exchanging them for another project inside MYCE. That would be the exact investor we are looking to be part of MYCE. In current models the profit and power of the network is within a company or development team, we are setting our incentives on spreading profit and power into holders.\r\n\r\nIn summary MYCE will:\r\n\r\n- Create it\u2019s own decentralized exchange\r\n- Simplify owning a masternode or staking them\r\n- Create it\u2019s own pool to mine coins on our network\r\n- Implement a dashboard to track MYCE stats and networked coins\r\n- Profit by helping other coins to fulfill their use cases"}, "links": {"homepage": ["https://www.myce.world", "", ""], "blockchain_site":
