With our free & affordable telemedicine services we can get the masses to benefit from blockchain technology in healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe Doc.com platform\u00b4s Doc for Doctors social network offers patient referrals, tools for doctors\u2019 everyday practice, and real-time reporting of epidemiological data for our clients and researchers. Serving all client sizes and requirements the Doc.com platform combines its Doc.com app and Doc for Doctors practice platform to derive high-end services such as real-time geographic epidemiological data reporting, automated AI-driven treatment and diagnosis suggestions for Doctors in institutions or private practice, massive access to patient populations for preventative campaigns, and Doc.com\u2019s advanced proprietary tools such as its AI-assisted Electronic Health Record and Digital Vademecum. \r\n\r\nA universal native Token: The Medical Token Currency, MTC is the fuel that is integrated into the services Doc.com provides. Already in talks with Healthcare institutions, Governments and partners to make MTC the preferred token for their own upcoming and existing medical services, as they migrate to decentralized platforms. We envision MTC will be used in the broader healthcare industry and any other industries for various purposes including payment and remittance.\r\n\r\nAlso Doc.com is expanding into Genomics and is building a decentralized hospital system that's not only digital but standardizes primary care under the Doc.com vision with mobile clinics. The Lifechain is the spinal cord of the systems and incentivizes use of Doc.com services while providing a level of transparency in use of data that no other healthcare provider in the world has.
