It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security. Furthermore, it will be way cheaper (10x-to-100x), faster, and more secure than traditional cloud storage services.Storj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, Storj Share, and Libstorj. It is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure online files.
