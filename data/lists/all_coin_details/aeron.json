The way it works is simple. The pilot\u2019s application is used for personal flight logging. The corporate application of the aviation company collects and verifies data from aviation schools, service companies, airlines, and aviation data operators. In case of an mismatch in data between any Aeron data source with either the ATC, pilot, or operator, aviation authorities can quickly see and eliminate the problem. Pilots operating under an expired license can also be monitored. As a consumer, or aviation school student, you have access to the verified global database through aerotrips.com. A simple alteration to safer air travel like blockchain can really make a difference. Air travel is for everyone, and it is beneficial for every single person to get involved in making trips safer.
