You can track the daily stats at www.wabi.io\r\n\r\nWabi was founded in 2013 by Alex Busarov and Yaz Belinskiy. The two founders first met in high school and after studying at the London School of Economics pursued careers in consulting at McKinsey and Bain respectively. Having worked on several important cases in the Consumer Goods industry, the two became convinced that there should be a more effective way to do marketing and that the inefficiencies in the FMCG industry that often resulted in public health risk were completely solvable with technology and determination.\r\n\r\n"}, "links": {"homepage": ["https://wabi.io/", "", ""], "blockchain_site": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0x286bda1413a2df81731d4930ce2f862a35a609fe", "https://ethplorer.io/address/0x286bda1413a2df81731d4930ce2f862a35a609fe", "", "", ""], "official_forum_url": ["", "", ""], "chat_url": ["", "", ""], "announcement_url": ["https://wabi.io/blog/", ""], "twitter_screen_name": "wabitoken", "facebook_username": "wabiico", "bitcointalk_thread_identifier": 2038385, "telegram_channel_identifier": "wabi_ico", "subreddit_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WabiToken", "repos_url": {"github": [], "bitbucket": []}}, "image": {"thumb": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1338/thumb/Tael.png?1547035364", "small": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1338/small/Tael.png?1547035364", "large": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1338/large/Tael.png?1547035364"}, "country_origin": "SG", "genesis_date": "2017-12-09", "contract_address": "0x286bda1413a2df81731d4930ce2f862a35a609fe", "sentiment_votes_up_percentage": 91.67, "sentiment_votes_down_percentage": 8.33, "ico_data": {"ico_start_date": "2017-11-28T00:00:00.000Z", "ico_end_date": "2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z", "short_desc": "Crypto token for safe consumer products", "description": "RFID based labels that can link blockchain with physical objects.
