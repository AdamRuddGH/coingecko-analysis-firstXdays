To provide all internet citizens with an opportunity to freely join and contribute to any district, to align incentives across all of a district\u2019s participants, and to implement coordinated decision-making mechanisms to the district0x Network, they introduce the district0x Network Token. The district0x Network Token (DNT) is a staking token, used by holders to join districts and participate in their governance. Upon staking district0x Network Tokens to a district, participants receive an equivalent amount of voting rights in the district. Voting rights can be used to partake in the processes that determine everything from a district\u2019s branding, to its accepted code of conduct, to the auxiliary modules that are integrated, to the way that fees collected by revenue-generating auxiliary modules are utilized, and beyond.", "links": {"web": "https://district0x.io/", "blog": "https://blog.district0x.io/", "slack":
