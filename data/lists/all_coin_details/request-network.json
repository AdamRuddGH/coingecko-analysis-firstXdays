The use of blockchain technology also eliminates the need for third-party processors, resulting in a reduction in transaction costs.\r\n\r\nThe Request Network leverages decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum and IPFS for an increased level of security, privacy and data ownership for the end-user. The platform does have transaction fees, which is a cost that is required to broadcast a change to the blockchain network. The transaction fees are used to incentivize miners to reach consensus on the state of the network.\r\n\r\nREQ can be stored on wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger, imToken, Trezor, Atomic Wallet, Jaxx Liberty and Trust Wallet.\r\n\r\nHow Many Request (REQ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\nREQ is an ERC-20 token that can be spent to use the Request Network.\r\n\r\nA portion of the REQ fee is burned at a rate that is determined by the current supply and the exchange rate with other currencies.\r\n\r\nRequest\u2019s (REQ) circulating supply is at 999,912,165 REQ as of February 2021 and the maximum supply is 999,983,984 tokens.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Request Network Secured?\r\nREQ is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum platform. The requests made with REQ are stored on an immutable digital ledger. This ledger also serves as proof for all auditing purposes."}, "links": {"homepage": ["https://request.network", "", ""], "blockchain_site":
