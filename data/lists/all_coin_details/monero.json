While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning \u201ccoin\u201d in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone\u2019s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient\u2019s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine.

Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning \u201ccoin\u201d in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone\u2019s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient\u2019s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine.
