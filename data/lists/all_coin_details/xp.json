Basically, consumers and community members can be rewarded in XP for interacting with a service or entity that has adopted the Experience Points platform, such as attending a concert or buying a meal at a restaurant that uses XP.  Users can then spend their XP at participating locations, allowing them to take the experience they\u2019ve gain and put it back into the XP-based economy.\r\n\r\nIn its current stage of development, Experience Points is more geared towards online gaming platforms and services.
