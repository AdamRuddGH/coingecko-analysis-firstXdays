We develop one Smart Contract at a time to solve the problems of centralized exchanges by combining solutions of decentralized and non-custodial exchanges to gradually moving towards \u200bcomplete decentralization of Peer to Peer\u200b (P2P) whether for Cryptos-Fiats or Cryptos-Cryptos conversions. In order to achieve and accomplish our goals we develop the best runway for Cryptos to take off, we provide hybrid solutions by borrowing features of CeX and implement on DeX while eliminating the disadvantages with innovative applications built on top of our ecosystem from \u200bStiB P2P, StiB Pay to StiB DeX plus AI Chat\u200b to assist everyone anytime/anywhere without forgetting a better and fair distribution model of profits through our StiB Reserves to all of our users who can invest or stake their token holdings. We design an ecosystem for the community, controlled and staked by the community through StiB tokens.\r\n1. A great time for Cryptos\u2019 mass adoption in this 2nd decade\r\n2. We have a great business model for mainstream adoption\r\n3. Now it\u2019s time to raise funds and scale the ecosystem as well as expand our team!\r\n4. We have an amazing team working around the clock 24/7 with creative ideas building\r\ninnovative applications to decentralize everything financially with everyone in mind."}, "links": {"homepage":
