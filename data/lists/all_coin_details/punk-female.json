As the NFT markets started to gain more attention, the price of CryptoPunks has been increasing exponentially. The main allure of CryptoPunks was their historical relevance as the first-ever NFTs on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nLarva Labs offered the CryptoPunks for free in 2017. All users had to do back then was to learn how to interact with Ethereum and claim it.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCryptoPunks are 24x24 pixel art images generated algorithmically.
