GameCoin claims to have found a way to do that using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nBasically, GameCoin\u2019s idea is to allow each game developer to create their own cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency is used as in-game money. The developers can create this cryptocurrency at virtually no cost to themselves \u2013 it\u2019s just a digital token that has value in the game. However, by the time it circulates through gamers, the token will have value because it can be used to pay for in-game items.\r\n\r\nIn more straightforward terms, GameCoin plans to make it easy for developers to create a secure in-game currency. It appears that these cryptocurrencies will operate as forks on the GameCoin blockchain. Each developer will be able to make their own fork \u2013 so gamers can easily apply their GWC tokens to any game of their choice (the GameCoin wallet will support all forks)."}, "links": {"homepage": ["http://www.game.com", "", ""], "blockchain_site": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0xB70835D7822eBB9426B56543E391846C107bd32C", "https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb70835d7822ebb9426b56543e391846c107bd32c", null, "", ""], "official_forum_url": ["", "", ""], "chat_url": ["", "", ""], "announcement_url": ["", ""], "twitter_screen_name": "gamecom666", "facebook_username": "Gamecom-2055954348021983", "bitcointalk_thread_identifier": 2258262, "telegram_channel_identifier": "gameico", "subreddit_url": null, "repos_url": {"github": ["https://github.com/GameLeLe/trade-addr-tx-service"], "bitbucket": []}}, "image": {"thumb": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2046/thumb/game.png?1547742459", "small": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2046/small/game.png?1547742459", "large": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2046/large/game.png?1547742459"}, "country_origin": "CN", "genesis_date": "2017-10-26", "contract_address": "0xb70835d7822ebb9426b56543e391846c107bd32c", "sentiment_votes_up_percentage": null, "sentiment_votes_down_percentage": null, "ico_data": {"ico_start_date": "2017-10-10T00:00:00.000Z", "ico_end_date": "2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z", "short_desc": "Game.com creating a new world!", "description": "Day One for Game.com is all about a strategy for globalization, and creating the foundation of an ICO service for the global game industry.
